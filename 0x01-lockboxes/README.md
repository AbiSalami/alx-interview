# 0x01 Lockboxes

This project contains a solution to the lockboxes problem. The goal is to determine if all boxes can be unlocked given a set of boxes with keys inside them.

## Files

- `0-lockboxes.py`: Contains the `canUnlockAll` function.
- `main_0.py`: Contains test cases for the `canUnlockAll` function.

## Usage

To run the tests, make sure both `0-lockboxes.py` and `main_0.py` are in the same directory and have executable permissions. Then run:

```bash
./main_0.p
